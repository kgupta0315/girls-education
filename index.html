                    What is the importance of shelter?
                    Shelter is a basic human need crucial for survival in cases of natural hazards or conflict.
                     It provides security, personal safety and protection from the weather, and prevents ill health and disease.

            <p class="center">
                Education has a global impact on girls. Education makes a person strong mentally, socially and intellectually by increasing our knowledge. Educated girls are confident. They can make decisions on their own and become self-reliant.     
                They can earn for themselves and take care of their families. They are independent and do not depend on men to validate their existence. 
                After the wedding, they can help their husband financially and add to the family income. Someone rightly said, "If you educate a man, you educate a person, but if you educate a woman, you educate the whole family and a nation."

             field of study, race, etc. Scholarship money does not have to be paid back as it is not a loan. They 
             come in the form of grants, tuition waivers and fellowships. Scholarship is a wonderful approach to assist students
